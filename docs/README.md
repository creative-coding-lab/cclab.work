## Course Information

Instructor: Marcela Godoy, Leon Eckert and J.H. Moon

Creative Coding Lab explores the fundamentals of computer programming and web development through a series of creative projects. The course aims to equip students with the skills to develop web-based applications that use the JavaScript language and the p5.js environment and include a significant computational component. Fundamental concepts, such as variables, functions, control flow, arrays, loops and object-oriented programming, are applied to create generative visuals, interactive experiences, and internet art projects. This course is intended for students with no prior programming experience.

### Overview and Learning Outcomes

Creative Coding Lab is structured in two phases, each of which ends with a larger project (“Project A” and “Project B”). In the first phase, students are using exclusively p5.js and are introduced to new programming concepts week by week. The second phase expands the purview to more broadly deal with the crafting of creative applications on the web - including modules about HTML, CSS, and media. 
To further familiarize each week’s learning, students work on a “Mini Project” that is introduced during recitation and usually due in the next class. 
The creative themes of the projects challenge students to think about subjects such as interactivity, generative patterns, reusability of code, or interfaces while creating drawing tools, designing imaginary creatures, building interactive photo booths, and more. 

#### Student Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:
- Practice and produce the fundamentals of programming, focusing on
  - variables, values, and variable mutation;
  - data types, operators, and expressions;
  - procedural statements — assignments, conditionals, and iterations (loops);
  - arrays;
  - functions;
    - use side effects, and
    - pure functions that return values;
- Demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and integrate the concept into practical applications by
  - utilizing predefined classes;
  - designing and implementing classes, and;
  - developing and manipulating arrays (lists) of objects;
- Discuss and apply the concept of modularity and reusability, utilizing the programming concepts and techniques mentioned above;
- Practice and display troubleshooting skills and debugging strategies, including:
  - ability to use online reference materials and example codes; and
  - uses of the developer console for debugging;
- ​​Create and deploy creative/interactive websites using GitHub Pages;
- Optimize media assets on the web and implement them with compositional strategies;
- Recognize and discuss the contexts of generative art, algorithmic animation, conditional design, human-computer interaction and the Internet; and
- Produce a generative/interactive web project by utilizing a combination of concepts and techniques discussed and demonstrated throughout the course.
