# Particles (OOP) | Step-by-Step Instructions

This template is a starting point. It already has a 'Particle' class defined, and three particles (instances of this class) are created in the setup(). Although you'll eventually generate more particles, let's begin by working with just these three.  

- [Particles \- Template](https://editor.p5js.org/MOQN/sketches/X89ZUgmZE)

Let's focus on defining the properties and methods for your particle class. Consider the unique characteristics and behaviors of your particles. For instance, if they are snowflakes, they should originate at the top and drift downwards. In the case of fireworks, they would start from the bottom and soar upwards. And if they represent dust particles, they might be scattered across the entire canvas.

Where will they be generated? Where should they originate from?  

- [Particles \- change the initial position](https://editor.p5js.org/MOQN/sketches/V52ZhK7o7)  
- [Particles \- randomize the initial position](https://editor.p5js.org/MOQN/sketches/KH_6g7Mtl)

What is their movement pattern? In which direction do they move? Is their movement swift or gradual?  

- [Particles \- move horizontally (left or right)](https://editor.p5js.org/MOQN/sketches/zxqSgPEN_)  
- [Particles \- move vertically (up or down)](https://editor.p5js.org/MOQN/sketches/w9l55e4c6)  
- [Particles \- randomize the speed and direction](https://editor.p5js.org/MOQN/sketches/hKrEuLpGP)  
- [Particles \- bounce](https://editor.p5js.org/MOQN/sketches/ZUDpJjnhX)  
- [Particles \- reappear](https://editor.p5js.org/MOQN/sketches/0WAH-CIkF)  
- [Particles \- bounce \+ slowDown](https://editor.p5js.org/MOQN/sketches/6hQ9zvHpD)  
- [Particles \- reappear \+ speedUp](https://editor.p5js.org/MOQN/sketches/LnPaFAG5Y)

What are their appearances like? Are they shaped like ellipses, rectangles, or custom-designed forms?  

- [Particles \- rectangular shapes](https://editor.p5js.org/MOQN/sketches/LWkvbQNcv)  
- [Particles \- vertex shape](https://editor.p5js.org/MOQN/sketches/L9-moA6U4)  
- [Particles \- multiple shapes](https://editor.p5js.org/MOQN/sketches/4ktIN2Kbl)

What is their size range? Big or small? Do the particles vary in size, or are they uniform? Also, does their size change over time, and do they exhibit any self-rotation?  

- [Particles \- enlarge](https://editor.p5js.org/MOQN/sketches/-n7bK5i7z)  
- [Particles \- shrink](https://editor.p5js.org/MOQN/sketches/Iu2XeXt3_)  
- [Particles \- rotate](https://editor.p5js.org/MOQN/sketches/yO5u_qmA9)  
- [Particles \- adjust scale (enlarge or shrink a vertex shape)](https://editor.p5js.org/MOQN/sketches/jA0orfnZc)

Do each of the particles feature distinct colors, or do they follow a uniform color palette?  

- [Particles \- assign an initial color](https://editor.p5js.org/MOQN/sketches/0IvsAbwS2)  
- [Particles \- assign a random color](https://editor.p5js.org/MOQN/sketches/C_WwEd8vm)  
- [Particles \- assign a random color from an array of color names](https://editor.p5js.org/MOQN/sketches/IJZaSd-k6)

Are the particles interactive, responding to user input? Let's explore methods that can modify their color and speed.  

- [Particles \- change the color by mouseIsPressed](https://editor.p5js.org/MOQN/sketches/3CZlwBi3z)  
- [Particles \- change the color by mousePressed()](https://editor.p5js.org/MOQN/sketches/wwQaWP6e_)  
- [Particles \- slowDown by mouseIsPressed](https://editor.p5js.org/MOQN/sketches/QtaHmY8-c)  
- [Particles \- explode by mousePressed()](https://editor.p5js.org/MOQN/sketches/BPfSwiZ1r)

Are the particles generated over time or by user actions? If so, remember to manage and limit the number of the objects.  

- [Particles \- generate at the center](https://editor.p5js.org/MOQN/sketches/AOmpW6z7E)  
- [Particles \- generate on mouse position](https://editor.p5js.org/MOQN/sketches/-b-LsMQ-e)  
- [Particles \- generate when mouse IS pressed](https://editor.p5js.org/MOQN/sketches/TC8YyHnwv)  
- [Particles \- generate by mousePressed()](https://editor.p5js.org/MOQN/sketches/4un5Ahw0c)  
- [Particles \- generate by keyPressed()](https://editor.p5js.org/MOQN/sketches/H-KtXRDWv)

What other actions would you like to see in the particles? You can design more intricate behaviors by utilizing multiple methods simultaneously. (and adding a little of Physics concepts :D )  

- [Particles \- fall (gravity)](https://editor.p5js.org/MOQN/sketches/Q0XbWydGb)  
- [Particles \- attractedTo](https://editor.p5js.org/MOQN/sketches/fGV4QxERh)  
- [Particles \- repelledFrom](https://editor.p5js.org/MOQN/sketches/LR8PGkcgF)
